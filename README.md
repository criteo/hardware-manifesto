# Criteo hardware manifesto

## We want privileged access to engineering

We have intimate knowledge of the systems we run. We don’t want to go through L1 or L2 for issues we already qualified; conversation should start at L3, possibly with the teams building the platform.

## We want to use our assets for as long as possible

5-year comprehensive support is a strict minimum. 7 to 9-year is our target. Spare parts availability, but also software support: new features, bugfixes, security patches…

## We want everything to be automation-ready

Our Infrastructure teams are greatly outnumbered by the quantity of assets they operate. Manual operations should therefore be avoided at all cost to work within our Infra-as-code approach, usually by means of API.

## We want open source software everywhere

Open source is key for troubleshooting, extended support and security. We aim at working only with companies that offer and support open source software so that we can audit, modify, deploy and maintain autonomously.

## We want to improve things for everyone

We are very keen on sharing what works and what doesn’t, so that things get better for everyone. If ideas and processes can help similar actors, we are happy to share mostly everything.

## We question spec sheets and put promises to the test

We are more interested in data sheets than marketing presentations. We thoroughly examine exhaustive (possibly NDA-level) specifications, ask questions, benchmark components & features on our use cases.

## We want to see what the future holds

Our planning and investments are months or even years ahead, so any valuable piece of information is a potential game changer. The ultimate goal being to influence vendors' designs and roadmaps.

## We consider all costs

We scrutinize many criteria beyond purchasing value (eg. power consumption, maintenance costs) and think in terms of TCO. This could mean buying more expensive assets if this helps us achieve our mission.

## We truly care about our environmental footprint

Given similar products, environmental impact would be a strong tie-breaker. Existing and future endeavors to improve impact should be communicated transparently and backed by relevant figures.
